This is really a simple console app, where you play 1D chess in the console against yourself.

The point of this was to build a perfect solver. It takes a few seconds to compute at the beginning.
Every possible move has the evaluation listed. 
Since the game is hard solved by this app, there are only the evaluations -1, 0 and 1.
